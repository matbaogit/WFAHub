You are an expert full-stack developer and UI/UX designer.  
Build an MVP web app called **WFA Hub** — a central platform where business users can access and run automation features instantly (no coding required).

---

### 🧩 Core Concept:
WFA Hub is a feature hub containing ready-made automation templates such as:
- Send Email with Attachment
- Send Quotation
- Schedule Reminder
- Leave Approval
- Contract Signing

Users can log in, view templates, configure quick settings, and execute each workflow with one click.

---

### 🔐 Authentication:
Include pages for:
- Login (Email + Password)
- Register (Email, Password, Confirm Password)
- Simple mock API for authentication
- After login → redirect to Dashboard

Use localStorage or a fake API service for session handling (for now).

---

### 🏠 Dashboard Layout:
- Top navigation bar: logo “WFA Hub”, user avatar dropdown (Profile, Logout)
- Sidebar menu: 
  - Dashboard (Trang chủ)
  - Templates (Tính năng)
  - Usage Logs (Lịch sử)
  - Account (Tài khoản)
- Main content area: responsive grid layout of feature cards

Each **Feature Card** shows:
- Icon
- Feature name
- Short description
- “Run Now” button

---

### ⚙️ Run Feature Flow:
When user clicks **Run Now**:
1. Open modal with a few input fields (like email, subject, attachment upload, message)
2. Button **“Execute”**
3. After click, show mock “Success” result + deduct credits (simulate credit balance)

---

### 💳 Account & Credits:
- Display credit balance at top-right corner (mock data)
- Each workflow deducts credits (simulate deduction visually)
- Option to “Top up credits” (dummy button for now)

---

### 🧾 Usage Logs Page:
- List all executed workflows with columns:
  - Date/time
  - Feature name
  - Status
  - Credits used

Use mock data, allow sorting or filtering.

---

### 🧠 API / Data (Mockup Level):
- Simulate API with local JSON or localStorage:
  - `/api/login`
  - `/api/register`
  - `/api/features`
  - `/api/run-feature`
  - `/api/logs`
- Show how to structure data for easy later integration with **ID Portal** via real API.

---

### 🎨 UX/UI Design Style:
- Clean, modern interface like **Linear.app** or **Framer dashboard**
- White background, blue primary color (`#1E88E5`)
- Rounded corners (16px), soft shadows
- Smooth transitions for modal and hover effects (Framer Motion style)
- Consistent spacing (use grid or flex)
- Responsive layout for both desktop and tablet

Use **Vietnamese** for all button labels and visible text, e.g.:
- “Đăng nhập”, “Đăng ký”, “Chạy ngay”, “Thực thi”, “Lịch sử”, “Tài khoản”, “Tính năng”

---

### 🔁 User Flow Summary:
1. User visits → Login/Register
2. Redirect to Dashboard
3. Sees all WFA templates (feature cards)
4. Click “Chạy ngay” → config modal → Execute → show result
5. Credits update & log saved
6. User can view “Lịch sử sử dụng” and “Tài khoản”

### 🧰 Technical Suggestion:
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion
- State: useContext or Redux Toolkit
- Backend (mock): local JSON or simple Node/Express mock server
- Later integration: prepare `/api/auth` and `/api/credits` endpoints for real use

---

Goal: Build a functional MVP with full UX flow and clean UI — ready for future API integration.
Start with the frontend (React + TailwindCSS) UI mock first, then we’ll connect mock APIs.
